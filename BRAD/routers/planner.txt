Use a prompt such as, "What role does PCNA play in the cell cycle and cell cycle imaging?", then 2. run the hwg analysis pipeline to find first order interactions of PCNA loaded from step 2. Next, (3.) Load the output file of the hwg codes (step 2) and perform gene enrichment and identify the pathways PCNA is involved in with enrichr.

The process should have 3 stages: (1) use the RAG to answer the question. (2) use arXiv (no other database) to find new research related to this question. (3) Decide if the answer from (1) is good and the system can exit or if the system should return to step (1) with the updated literature. Do not use the module name outside of the ""Step X (method, <Module Name>)""

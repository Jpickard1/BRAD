Extract relevant data from the HWG.mat file using a Python-based bioinformatics pipeline. This pipeline should be specifically designed to identify genes interacting with MYOD in the context of the hardwired genome.
Use a pre-existing bioinformatics pipeline to identify and analyze first order gene interactions involving MYOD in the provided HWG.mat data. This step may require input data in a specific format, so preprocess the data accordingly.

Based on the results from Step 3, build a new or modify an existing bioinformatics pipeline to retrieve relevant data about the pathways and cell types identified in the previous steps.
Analyze the newly retrieved data from Step 6 then integrate the findings from this step with the results gathered in previous steps using existing or newly developed bioinformatics pipelines.
Develop a custom bioinformatics pipeline using R or Python to identify first-order interactions of MYOD in HWG.mat. Utilize appropriate tools such as ChIPSeeker, GenomeQuest, or HOMER for analyses.
Use the identified genes and pathways from the GSEA to perform additional analyses, such as further gene expression analyses or pathway analyses if needed. This can be accomplished using R or Python and relevant libraries or tools.

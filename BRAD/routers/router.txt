Use WRITE to synthesize and summarize the findings from Steps 1-3, creating a final report that encapsulates the role of PCNA in the cell cycle and cell cycle imaging, its first-order interactions, and the pathways it is involved in. Use ROUTER to review the report and ensure all necessary information has been covered.
"Summarize the findings from Steps 1-3 in a small report, highlighting the role of PCNA in the cell cycle and cell cycle imaging, the first-order interactions of PCNA, and the enriched pathways it is involved in."

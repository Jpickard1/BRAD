Use RAG to look up literature and documents from a text database related to Chewbacca's role in defending Hoth during episode 5 of Star Wars. Analyze the confidence level of the results.
Evaluate the confidence level of the RAG results from Step 1. If the confidence level is above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.8), proceed to Step 5. Otherwise, proceed to Step 3.
Use RAG to analyze the newly retrieved articles from Step 3 and update the confidence level of the results. Repeat this process until the confidence level meets the threshold. Use information from Step 3.
Use WRITE to synthesize and summarize the information gathered from the RAG analysis. Create a detailed report on the role of Chewbacca in defending Hoth during episode 5 of Star Wars, incorporating all relevant findings.

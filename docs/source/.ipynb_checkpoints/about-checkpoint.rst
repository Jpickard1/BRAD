About BRAD
==========

The focus of this project is on developing a system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to support a range of bioinformatics research tasks. The core of this project involves the design and implementation of a modular framework intended to assist in various research activities, including literature search, gene enrichment, and software execution.

The primary aim of the project is to create a tool that can automate and streamline standard bioinformatics workflows. By integrating multiple modules, this tool seeks to facilitate tasks such as constructing and querying databases, executing software pipelines, and generating responses to user queries based on curated information.

Key Features
------------

- **Modular Architecture**: The system is designed with a modular approach, allowing for flexibility in integrating and utilizing different tools and components.
- **Automated Workflows**: The tool is intended to automate repetitive and well-defined tasks, such as running predefined software pipelines and performing standard data enrichment.
- **Information Retrieval**: It incorporates mechanisms for retrieving and processing information from various sources, including literature databases and online repositories.
- **Custom Code Execution**: The system supports the execution of custom code in Python, MATLAB, and Bash, enhancing its capability to perform specialized tasks as needed.

Future Work
-----------

Ongoing efforts aim to improve the coordination between different modules and enhance the overall systemâ€™s ability to manage complex workflows. Further development will focus on refining the planning and execution processes to better support the goal of creating a more autonomous digital laboratory environment.

    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with BRAD\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a collection of documents (pdfs), the RAG first builds a database by splitting up the text into equal size ('chunk_size'). These chunks can optionally be set to have some overlap ('chunk_overlap'). Both of these values within BRAD are set to 700 and 200 respectively but can be manually changed for different applications. Then, we vectorize these chunks using an embedding model from HuggingFace (Note - this step may take a while). Then, given a query, it embeds the query in the same embedding space and finds the top k chunks (preset to 4) with the closest cosine similarity to the query in the embedding space and uses these chunks as a basis for the response."

      "expressed, how does Myod regulate skeletal muscle cell\n",
      "differentiation? In one sense, the answer seems fairly simple:Myod is a transcription factor with binding sites in theregulatory regions of many genes that are expressed in skeletalmuscle. Myod forms heterodimers with the nearly ubiquitousE-protein sub-family of bHLH proteins through the interactionof the HLH domains (see Fig. 1) (Lassar et al., 1991; Murre etal., 1989). The basic regions act as sequence-speciﬁc DNA-binding domains that recognize a binding site with the simplecore consensus sequence of CANNTG, termed an E-box, andshow additional preferences for internal and ﬂankingsequences (Blackwell and Weintraub, 1990). Myod has a singleamino-terminal acidic-activation domain, as determined by its\n",
      "fusion to the heterologous DNA-binding domain of the Gal4\n",
      "protein (Weintraub et al., 1991b), whereas E-proteins have amore complex mix of activation and repression domains(Markus et al., 2002) (see Fig. 1). Therefore, the simple\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a positive correlation between regulated MyoD\n",
      "binding (i.e., sites that are preferentially bound in myoblasts or\n",
      "differentiated myotubes) and gene expression. This suggests\n",
      "that sites regulating gene transcription in myotubes require addi-tional factors to modulate MyoD binding. Indeed, the sites asso-\n",

      "factors that are activated by MyoD and function with MyoD ina positive feed-forward circuit, as demonstrated previouslywith Mef2 ( Penn et al., 2004 ) and Myog ( Cao et al., 2006 ). In addi-\n",

      "differentiation? In one sense, the answer seems fairly simple:Myod is a transcription factor with binding sites in theregulatory regions of many genes that are expressed in skeletalmuscle. Myod forms heterodimers with the nearly ubiquitousE-protein sub-family of bHLH proteins through the interactionof the HLH domains (see Fig. 1) (Lassar et al., 1991; Murre etal., 1989). The basic regions act as sequence-speciﬁc DNA-binding domains that recognize a binding site with the simplecore consensus sequence of CANNTG, termed an E-box, andshow additional preferences for internal and ﬂankingsequences (Blackwell and Weintraub, 1990). Myod has a singleamino-terminal acidic-activation domain, as determined by its\n",

(Context: a combination of promoter-specific regulation of Myod binding and activity. Because Myod initiates the myogenic differentiation program and that program temporally regulates the activity of Myod, it follows that Myod programs the regulation of its own activity. It does this, at least in part, through a feed-forward mechanism.)\n",

MyoD and Myf-5 are important in myogenesis, but mice with homogenous gene-targeted mutations in either MyoD or Myf-5 produce fairly normal amounts of muscle (Rudnicki et al., 1992; Braun et al., 1992). The paradox of the large role of MyoD in converting cells into muscle but normal muscle production in knockout mice was recently resolved by showing that in the double homoygous mutants, both MyoD and Myfd are involved in the process.\n",

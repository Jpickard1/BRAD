Our studies corroborate that direct cellular reprogramming informs the process of HSC speciﬁcation and of- fers tractable means to systematically interrogate pathways of human HSC formation. It will be interesting to address the role of other enriched pathways such as cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPase and the histamine H1 receptor pathway. Genes that are co-targeted during hematopoietic reprogramming by GATA2 and GFI1B are additional candidates for further study (e.g., ITGA2, PLCL1, ADRA1B, RHOJ, SEMA3A, and PLCB1; see\n",

The second main region of interaction involves JUNB binding to reprogramming TF motifs-enriched (i.e., MEF2C, ASCL1, KLF4, and cMYC) closed chromatin (Fig. 3). In this context, our comparative chromatin accessibility analysis (siControl vs siAJSZ) during cardiac reprogramming of HDFs (Fig. 4), shows that under control conditions, pre-existing binding of JUNB to reprogramming TF (MEF2C) motif-enriched regions (domain 2), remains in a closed state even when MGT is overexpressed, thus contributing to limit repro- gramming TF access to target its DNA\n",

      "Abstract | The past 10 years have seen great advances in our ability to manipulate cell fate, including the induction of pluripotency in vitro to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This process proved to be remarkably simple from a technical perspective, only needing the host cell and a defined cocktail of transcription factors, with four factors — octamer-binding protein 3/4 (OCT3/4), SOX2, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and MYC (collectively referred to as OSKM) —\n",

Furthermore, it has been clearly shown that the culture environment is important for successful reprogramming, and modification of the culture medium can increase the reprogramming efficiency. For instance the LIF–STAT3 (leukaemia inhibitor factor–signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) pathway was shown to be an active player in induced mouse pluripotency163. Treatment with inhibitors of MEK (for example, PD0325901) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (for example, CHIR99021) — which are termed 2i — allows mouse ES cells to undergo LIF-independent self-renewal and increases the homogeneity of the cell population, thus facilitating the efficiency of\n",

      "In any given cell, a set of transcription factors (TFs) is ex- pressed and works in concert to govern cellular homeosta- sis and function (1). The Transcriptional Regulatory Net- works (TRNs) in somatic cells are believed to be robust and act to prevent cells from aberrant plasticity (2). However, recent works have revealed that somatic cells in mammals are more plastic than previously thought (3). Particularly, Takahashi and Yamanaka demonstrated this\n",

UCB Lin- CD34+ cells and non-transduced HDFs were proﬁled as con- trols. Genome-wide unsupervised hierarchical clustering shows that most single cells cluster according to sample group, with a clear separation of HDF from reprogrammed cells. Just 2 days after transgene activation, ﬁbroblasts show a dramatic transcrip- tional change. Importantly, endogenous expression of GFI1B and GATA2 is absent at day 2 but activated in reprogrammed cells (Figure S4F), suggesting that the reprogramming process\n",

      "Abstract | The past 10 years have seen great advances in our ability to manipulate cell fate, including the induction of pluripotency in vitro to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This process proved to be remarkably simple from a technical perspective, only needing the host cell and a defined cocktail of transcription factors, with four factors — octamer-binding protein 3/4 (OCT3/4), SOX2, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and MYC (collectively referred to as OSKM) —\n",

We found that responsiveness seemed to identify a superset of the cell type-specific genes, meaning that there were many genes whose expression was responsive but not particularly cell type-specific. When we explicitly tested whether these responsive-but-not-cell type-specific genes could affect maintenance, we found that, for fully half the factors we tested, suppression of the factor led to an increase in reprogramming\n",

      "Hence we reasoned that responsiveness might also identify previously undescribed factors that maintain cellular identity. One way to test this hypothesis is in reprogramming from a source to target cell type: we reasoned that the downregulation of factors that are responsive in the source cell type may interfere with source cell type maintenance, manifesting as an enhancement of reprogramming to the target cell type. We tested this possibility by focusing on the induction of induced pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts, i.e., fibroblast reprogramming.\n",

      "In any given cell, a set of transcription factors (TFs) is ex- pressed and works in concert to govern cellular homeosta- sis and function (1). The Transcriptional Regulatory Net- works (TRNs) in somatic cells are believed to be robust and act to prevent cells from aberrant plasticity (2). However, recent works have revealed that somatic cells in mammals are more plastic than previously thought (3). Particularly, Takahashi and Yamanaka demonstrated this\n",

In principle, responsiveness could have identified a proper subset of the cell type-specific genes, a superset of the cell type-specific genes, a wholly distinct set of genes, or a partially overlapping subset. We found that responsiveness seemed to identify a superset of the cell type-specific genes, meaning that there were many genes whose expression was responsive but not particularly cell type-specific. When we explicitly tested whether these responsive-but-not-cell type-specific genes could affect maintenance, we found that, for fully half the factors we tested, suppression of the factor led to an increase in reprogramming\n",

This validation rate suggests that these responsive 3 factors are indeed important for cell type maintenance and not merely falsely identified by P ​. The fact that these non-cell type-specific factors are important for maintenance suggests that cell type maintenance may involve factors that act as general barriers to cell type transformations in addition to factors specific to particular types.

       "' Myod is a master switch transcription factor that is involved in cell reprogramming of skeletal muscle. The cloning of Myod, a bHLH transcription factor, led to the identification of Myod1 as a regulator of skeletal myogenesis.Myod can induce skeletal muscle differentiation in cells from many different lineages. It interacts with other transcription factors, histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling complexes, and regulatory elements to reset the cellular chromatin structure and specify the skeletal muscle lineage. Other bHLH proteins, such as Myf5, also regulate complex programs of differentiation in muscle cell specification. The binding and activity of Myod is also regulated by other factors to achieve a temporal patterning of gene expression through a feed-forward mechanism. The Pbx/Meis complex is emerging as a marker for Myod activation. In the myoblast, Myod is associated with histone deacetylases and might actively suppress gene expression, but in the differentiating muscle cell, it is associated with histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling complexes and activates gene expression.'"

Chromatin context plays an instructive role in their activity by providing an environment for their binding. Other factors, such as those discovered through recent studies on chromatin-associated complexes, may also contribute to myogenic reprogramming, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.\"]\n",

The key idea is to approximate the linear dynamics of the system using snapshots of data.\\\\n\\\\nGiven a sequence of snapshots X = [x1, x2, ..., xm] and Y = [x2, x3, ..., xm+1], where each snapshot xi represents the state of the system at time ti, DMD seeks to find a matrix A such that:\\\\n\\\\n    Y ≈ AX\\\\n\\\\nTo achieve this, DMD solves the following optimization problem:\\\\n\\\\n    A = Y X^†\\\\n\\\\nwhere X^† is the pseudoinverse of X.\\\\n\\\\nTo compute the DMD modes and eigenvalues, we perform the following steps:\\\\n1. Compute the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of X:\\\\n\\\\n    X = UΣV*\\\\n\\\\n2. Approximate A using the reduced-order model:\\\\n\\\\n    Ã = U^* Y V Σ^(-1)\\\\n\\\\n3. Compute the eigendecomposition of Ã:\\\\n\\\\n    ÃW = WΛ\\\\n\\\\nwhere Λ contains the eigenvalues and W contains the eigenvectors (DMD modes).\\\\n\\\\nThe DMD rank parameter controls the amount of reduced-order modeling. A value of -1 indicates no model reduction, using the full rank of the data matrix.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**OUTPUT FILE NAME INSTRUCTIONS**\\\\n1.

      "--------------------------------\n",
      "DMD is a data-driven modeling method that decomposes a given dataset into a collection of dynamic modes, each associated with a fixed frequency, growth/decay rate, and amplitude. The key idea is to approximate the linear dynamics of the system using snapshots of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given a sequence of snapshots X = [x1, x2, ..., xm] and Y = [x2, x3, ..., xm+1], where each snapshot xi represents the state of the system at time ti, DMD seeks to find a matrix A such that:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Y ≈ AX\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this, DMD solves the following optimization problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "    A = Y X^†\n",
      "\n",
      "where X^† is the pseudoinverse of X.\n",
      "\n",
      "To compute the DMD modes and eigenvalues, we perform the following steps:\n",
      "1. Compute the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of X:\n",
      "\n",
      "    X = UΣV*\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Approximate A using the reduced-order model:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Ã = U^* Y V Σ^(-1)\n",

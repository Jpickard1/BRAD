You may select 3 state\\nvariables, numbered 0, 1, ..., 10-1 to measure.\\n\\n**Strategy**\\nDeploy the following strategy to select your sensors: GREEDY ALGORITHM. In this round, choose a single\\nstarting sensors $i$, and the rank of the observability matrix will be reported. Then, in subsequent rounds\\nchoose sensor sets that include $i$ and one other sensor at a time. Based on testing $i$ with each other sensor\\nand the ranks of the observablity matrix, in a final step, you will select the next best vertex to add. We will\\nthen repeat this process until the rank stops increasing.\\n\\nGiven this strategy, you must propose the single initial sensor to start with. This will initialize the checking\\nand rest of the proceedure. Your response will be parsed by software, so it must conform to our output structure.\\nPleased do not provide any additional output, or explination at this time. \\n\\nPlease provide your output in the format of a comma separated list, and do not add additional output.\\n\\n**Output Format**\\nSensors=<sensor 1, ..., sensor 3>\\n', 'output': 'Sensors=0', 'parsedOutput': 'Sensors=0', 'purpose': 'chat without RAG'}]}\n"

First, I want you to use the RAG and tell me how confident you are in your answer. Then, if you are not confident, I want you to webscrape articles related to Chewy, and perform RAG analysis again based upon these new articles. Continue doing this until you are confident in your RAG answer, and then write a report on what you learned. This should have the following steps: 1. RAG, 2. ROUTER, 3. SCRAPE 4. RAG, 5. WRITE.

      " The STRING database is a resource for protein-protein interaction information. It provides various types of interactions including experimental, curated, and predicted interactions. The database also integrates interaction data from different sources and provides added value services such as curating metadata, maintaining common name spaces, and devising ontologies and standards. In addition to STRING, there are other databases that provide protein interaction information at a wider scope, integrating both primary and predicted interactions. Some examples of these databases include GeneMania, FunCoup, I2D, ConsensusPathDb, IMP, and HumanNet. STRING uses text-mining and hierarchical clustering to identify protein interactions. It also provides a functional enrichment analysis feature for users who query the database with a set of proteins. The database is available online at <https://string-db.org/>.\n",

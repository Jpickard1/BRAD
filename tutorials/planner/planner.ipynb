      "BRAD:  PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) plays a crucial role in the cell cycle, particularly in DNA replication and repair. During the cell cycle, PCNA localization and levels change, making it a useful marker for cell cycle phase analysis. In the G1 phase, PCNA is present in the nucleus at low levels, while in the S phase, PCNA levels increase and form foci at replication sites. In the G2 phase, PCNA levels decrease, and in the M phase, PCNA is absent. PCNA can be used in cell cycle imaging to monitor cell cycle progression and detect cell cycle phase transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "PCNA can also be used in combination with other cell cycle reporters, such as Cdt1 and Geminin, to analyze the cell cycle in mammalian cells. PCNA can provide additional information about progression within S phase and does not require an additional channel for cell tracking, making it a popular choice for time-lapse microscopy. Other reporters of kinase activity, transcription, and ubiquitin ligase activity can be used simultaneously with PCNA for further analysis of cell cycle regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, PCNA is involved in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and the commitment to proliferation. In particular, the levels of p21, a CDK inhibitor, can predict whether daughter cells will cycle, and the degradation of p21 by the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase is required for cell cycle progression.\n",

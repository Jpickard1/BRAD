PCNA is mentioned as a marker for the beginning and end of the S phase in living cells, indicating its role in delineating cell cycle phase transitions accurately.\n2. PCNA is described as a processivity factor for DNA polymerase epsilon and delta, essential for DNA replication during the S phase.\n3. The PCNA reporter is noted for precisely marking the boundaries of the S phase, emphasizing its importance in tracking cell cycle progression.\n4. PCNA is involved in regulating passage through the S phase and the transition from G2 to M phase, indicating its role in coordinating cell cycle progression.\n5. PCNA is used in cell cycle imaging to visualize and track cell cycle phases, providing insights into the dynamics of cell division.\n\nIn summary, PCNA plays a crucial role in DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and accurate cell cycle imaging by serving as a marker for specific cell cycle phases, particularly the S phase.\n\n\nHuman: Execute the HWG analysis pipeline to find first-order interactions of PCNA.\n\nBRAD: ******************************\nFinding 1st Order Interactions\n******************************\n\n\nHuman: Load the the 'Genes' column from the output file made during step 2 and use search these genes in Enrichr.\n\nBRAD: Load the the 'Genes' column from the output file made during step 2 and use search these genes in Enrichr.The following table was generated by quering the gene list against GO_Biological_Process_2021:\n\n\n\n",

You must determine if there already exist a predesigned pipeline that will respond to a user\\'s query, or if a new, custom process must be designed for this particular query. The multi-step workflow can use the available methods listed below.\\n\\n**Available Methods within a Pipeline:**\\n1. **RAG**: Look up literature and documents from a text database.\\n2. **SCRAPE**: Search platforms like arXiv, bioRxiv, and PubMed for the latest research.\\n3. **DATABASE**: Utilize bioinformatics databases such as Gene Ontology and Enrichr to perform gene set enrichment analyses.\\n4. **CODE**: Execute bioinformatics pipelines. Utilize prebuilt pipelines or develop new ones as needed.\\n5. **WRITE**: Synthesize and summarize information. This can include summarizing database searches, code pipeline results, or creating a final report to encapsulate the entire analysis.\\n6. **ROUTER**: Determine which step we should proceed to next.\\n\\nUser Query: {input}\\n\\n**Available Pipelines**\\nName: PCNA-pipeline\\tDescription: use this for all queries about PCNA\\n\\n\\nCUSTOM: The option to build a new pipeline\\n\\nThe custom pipeline should be selected if no current pipeline addreses the user\\'s query. If the custom pipeline is selected, please do not attempt to design the pipeline now. We will work to design it at a later point.\\n\\n**Output**:\\nPlease formate your output as follows:\\nPipeline Name: <available pipeline name above or \"CUSTOM\">\\nExplination: <reason for selecting the above pipeline>\\n'",

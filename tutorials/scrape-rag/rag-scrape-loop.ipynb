      "Single-cell foundation models are Large Language Models that are adapted and trained to interpret and distinguish cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing data. They have the potential to uncover new biological insights by accurately categorizing known cell types, demonstrating their effectiveness as tools for understanding complex cellular systems. These models can also leverage external descriptions and common knowledge from Large Language Models to enhance the representation of single-cell omics data. Recent research has focused on building and refining these foundation models for single-cell multi-omics data using self-supervised learning and generative AI techniques.\n",

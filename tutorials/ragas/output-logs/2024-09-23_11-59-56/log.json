        "output": "B cells undergo affinity maturation during the germinal center reaction by accumulating affinity-enhancing mutations in their IgV genes through several rounds of interzonal cycles. Germinal center B cells with the highest affinity are selected to recirculate to the dark zone for further division and somatic hypermutation (SHM), leading to their dominance in the population within a few days. T follicular helper (TFH) cells provide crucial signals to facilitate the selection and transit of high-affinity germinal center B cells.",

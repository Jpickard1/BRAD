        "output": "B cells undergo affinity maturation during the germinal center reaction through a process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection. Within the germinal center, B cells undergo SHM, introducing random mutations into their antibody genes. B cells with mutations that result in higher affinity antibodies for the antigen they are targeting are positively selected to survive and proliferate, while those with lower affinity are outcompeted. This process leads to the generation of memory B cells and plasma cells with antibodies of increased affinity over time, which is essential for their effectiveness in curtailing and preventing infection.",

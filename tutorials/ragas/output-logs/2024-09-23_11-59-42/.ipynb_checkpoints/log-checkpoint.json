        "output": "B cells undergo affinity maturation during the germinal center reaction through a process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the dark zone, leading to the diversification of IgV genes. This results in the production of mutant B cell clones with varying affinities for the antigen. In the light zone, high-affinity clones are positively selected while lower-affinity clones are eliminated. Recirculation between zones allows for multiple rounds of mutation and selection, ultimately leading to the generation of memory B cells and plasma cells that produce high-affinity antibodies.",

        "output": "During the germinal center reaction, B cells undergo affinity maturation by accumulating affinity-enhancing mutations in their IgV genes through several rounds of interzonal cycles. Germinal center B cells with the highest affinity are directed to recirculate to the dark zone for further division and somatic hypermutation (SHM), leading to the dominance of high-affinity B cells in the population within a few days. T follicular helper (TFH) cells provide crucial signals for the selection and transit of high-affinity germinal center B cells.",

This indicates a mechanism by which affin -\nity maturation is achieved following several rounds of \ninterzonal cycles. In a \u2018feedforward\u2019 loop, the GC B\u00a0cells \nwith the highest affinity are repeatedly instructed to recir -\nculate to the dark zone to undergo further rounds of divi -\nsion and SHM. As a result of this iterative process, GC \nB\u00a0cells with the highest affinity dominate the population \nof B\u00a0cells participating in the GC reaction within only a \nfew days following the initiation of the GC reaction.The findings described above show that TFH cells \nprovide crucial signals to high-affinity GC B\u00a0cells to \nfacilitate their selection, and their transit back to and \ndivision in the dark zone (TFH cells have been thor -\noughly reviewed elsewhere76,77). The exact nature of \nthese signals remains unclear and is being actively \ninvestigated in the field. Light zone\n\n**OUTPUT**\n<put summary output here>\n",

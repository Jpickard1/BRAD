        "output": "B cells undergo affinity maturation during the germinal center reaction through a process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection. Within the germinal center, B cells undergo SHM, introducing random mutations into their antibody genes. These mutations lead to changes in the affinity of the antibodies produced by the B cells. Through a selection process, B cells with higher affinity antibodies are preferentially chosen to survive and proliferate, while those with lower affinity are outcompeted. This iterative process of mutation and selection leads to the production of B cells with antibodies of increased affinity over time.",

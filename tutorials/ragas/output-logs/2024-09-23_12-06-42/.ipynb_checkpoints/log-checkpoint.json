        "output": "During the germinal center reaction, B cells undergo affinity maturation through a process called somatic hypermutation. This process involves the introduction of random mutations in the genes encoding the B cell receptor (BCR) in the germinal center. B cells with mutations that result in higher affinity for the antigen are positively selected for survival and proliferation, while those with lower affinity may undergo apoptosis. This iterative process leads to the generation of B cells with higher affinity BCRs, which are crucial for the production of high-affinity antibodies during an immune response.",

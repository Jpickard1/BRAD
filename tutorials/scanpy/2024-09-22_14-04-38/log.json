        "output": "The relationship between PORE-C and hypergraphs involves using Pore-C data to construct hypergraphs that represent multi-way contacts among loci. Hypergraphs contain hyperedges that can connect any number of nodes at once, unlike graphs which can only connect two nodes. This approach allows for the analysis of multi-way chromatin structure captured by Pore-C data, providing insights into genome architecture. Additionally, analyzing models in the framework of hypergraphs is simpler compared to simplicial complexes, and hypergraphs can efficiently handle large hyperedges and heterogeneous distribution of sizes.",

An appropriate value of \u03b5is typically obtained\nat the plateau of the persistence graph (see [59] for details).\nOn the right, the visual encoding control panel (g) provides\nvarious visual encodings for the hypergraph, see Fig. 1 for an\nexample. The panel also provides options to display vertex and\nhyperedge labels. The parameter control panel (h) deals with\nparameter con\ufb01guration. A large input hypergraph can be pre-\nprocessed to allow vertex collapse and hyperedge collapse. It\nis important to point out that collapsing the hypergraph here\naffects the weights in the line graph or clique expansion, which\nin turn affects the barcode. If two edges intersect in kvertices,\nand those kvertices are collapsed into \u2113 <ksupervertices, then\nthe weight between those hyperedges will be \u2113, not k.

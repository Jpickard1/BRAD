### Documentation

To build the projects documentation in the ReadTheDocs html formatting, in the `docs/` directory, run the command `make html`. This will populate the `docs/build/html` directory with the webpages. The `docs/build/` directory is excluded from git but *will* automatically be built when pushing to main.

The `dev-v0` branch contains all the code produced during the first round of development of BRAD up until the submission of the artilce. This branch is saved in case the developed code is useful. However, much of the developed code is unused, redundant, no longer required, or for features not outlined in the paper. These codes will be removed from MAIN but can be merged in from this branch at a later time point.

This branch was developed in the summer of 2024 by:
- Joshua Pickard
- Marc Choi
- Natalie Oliven
- Vivan Nyati
